# Automatic Email Sender using Python
Welcome to the Automatic Email Sender project using Python! This project is designed to automate the process of sending emails to multiple recipients with personalized content using Python. It uses the smtplib library to send emails via an email service provider (SMTP server). The script allows you to load a list of recipients, compose personalized emails using Jinja2 templates, and send them in bulk without manual intervention.

# Features
- Send personalized emails to multiple recipients at once.
- Use your own email service provider's SMTP settings for sending emails.
